# React Tic Tac Toe

## About Us And The Project

We are Rana and Yosef :) We made this tic tac toe game using react and it's components and we did some modifications to the game which was not included in the react docs.

# How We Made It

1. We used create react app to build the file structure

2. We wrote three main components and then we started tracking changes of the squares

3. And then we've lifted up the state from the child component to it's parent (the board)

4. Then we wrote our helper function which detects for a winner

5. Then we made the movements history so we had to left the state up again from the board to it's parent (the app/game)

6. We made the players form so we have a name for the person playing with x or o

7. We wrote down the CSS styles for our app and made responsive

8. Finally we did the last modification which is a leader board where we store all the winners

# How To Play

## First

Two players must enter their names or the game won't start (we did this in the app state)

## Second

You just need to simply play and someone is gotta win :)

## Third

There will be a list to the right which lets you go back in time or even restart the game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
